Minimal Netlify Functions example with a single file static HTML frontend and no dependencies.

[![Deploy with Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/ekafyi/smol-netlify-functions)

This template may be useful if:

- You don't need a frontend; you only need to develop the lambda functions
- You have a static frontend (HTML, CSS, JS files in a folder) that requires no build process/command
- You are new to how Netlify lambda functions work and want to explore without getting distracted by all dependencies and packages from the frontend web apps
